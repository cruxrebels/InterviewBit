/*
Write a program to solve a Sudoku puzzle by filling the empty cells.
Empty cells are indicated by the character '.' 
You may assume that there will be only one unique solution.

For the above given diagrams, the corresponding input to your program will be

[[53..7....], [6..195...], [.98....6.], [8...6...3], [4..8.3..1], [7...2...6], [.6....28.], [...419..5], [....8..79]]
