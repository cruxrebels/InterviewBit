/*
You are given a string, S, and a list of words, L, that are all of the same length.

Find all starting indices of substring(s) in S that is a concatenation of each word in L exactly once and without any intervening characters.

Example :

S: "barfoothefoobarman"
L: ["foo", "bar"]
You should return the indices: [0,9].
(order does not matter).
