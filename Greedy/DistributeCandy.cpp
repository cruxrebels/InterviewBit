Each child must have at least one candy.
Children with a higher rating get more candies than their neighbors.
What is the minimum candies you must give?

Sample Input :

Ratings : [1 2]
Sample Output :

The candidate with 1 rating gets 1 candy and candidate with rating cannot get 1 candy as 1 is its neighbor. 
So rating 2 candidate gets 2 candies. In total, 2+1 = 3 candies need to be given out.
