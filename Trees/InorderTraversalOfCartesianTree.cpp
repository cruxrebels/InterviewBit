/*
Given an inorder traversal of a cartesian tree, construct the tree.

 Cartesian tree : is a heap ordered binary tree, where the root is greater than all the elements in the subtree. 
 Note: You may assume that duplicates do not exist in the tree. 
Example :

Input : [1 2 3]

Return :   
          3
         /
        2
       /
      1
