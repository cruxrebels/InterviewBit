/*
Given an array where elements are sorted in ascending order, convert it to a height balanced BST.

 Balanced tree : a height-balanced binary tree is defined as a binary tree in which the depth of the two subtrees of every node never differ by more than 1. 
Example :


Given A : [1, 2, 3]
A height balanced BST  : 

      2
    /   \
   1     3
