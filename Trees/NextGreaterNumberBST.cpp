/*
Given a BST node, return the node which has value just greater than the given node.

Example:

Given the tree

               100
              /   \
            98    102
           /  \
         96    99
          \
           97
Given 97, you should return the node corresponding to 98 as thats the value just greater than 97 in the tree.
If there are no successor in the tree ( the value is the largest in the tree, return NULL).

Using recursion is not allowed.

Assume that the value is always present in the tree.
