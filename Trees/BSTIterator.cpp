/*
Implement an iterator over a binary search tree (BST). Your iterator will be initialized with the root node of a BST.

The first call to next() will return the smallest number in BST. Calling next() again will return the next smallest number in the BST, and so on.

 Note: next() and hasNext() should run in average O(1) time and uses O(h) memory, where h is the height of the tree.
Try to optimize the additional space complexity apart from the amortized time complexity.
