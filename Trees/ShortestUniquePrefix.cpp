/*
Find shortest unique prefix to represent each word in the list.

Example:

Input: [zebra, dog, duck, dove]
Output: {z, dog, du, dov}
where we can see that
zebra = z
dog = dog
duck = du
dove = dov
 NOTE : Assume that no word is prefix of another. In other words, the representation is always possible.
