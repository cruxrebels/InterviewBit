/*
Given a binary tree, flatten it to a linked list in-place.

Example :
Given


         1
        / \
       2   5
      / \   \
     3   4   6
The flattened tree should look like:

   1
    \
     2
      \
       3
        \
         4
          \
           5
            \
             6
Note that the left child of all nodes should be NULL.
